/*
We write our CSS according to Maintainable CSS: https://maintainablecss.com/

This means we organize our styles into modules (collections of components),
components, and states (which typically modify the normal styles, eg an error state)

To avoid difficulties overriding selectors with a high specificity we use
flat, class-based selectors of the form `.module-component-state`.

Sadly, the `django-sass` library doesn't allow for importing files from a parent
directory, so we don't nest our Sass files in directories like `modules/`.
